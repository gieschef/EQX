# EQX : EQuipment eXchange

EQX is a standard XML data format for exchanging information about sensors and testsetups to make exchange of equipment and metadata informaion on testsetups easier in daily testing process.
Focus is on special needs in vehicle safety and crash testing.

## EQX specification is an ISO new work item 
Over the last years EQX was developed and improved up to **version 1.5
ISO project started in july and is referenced as **ISO NP TS 23520**, check out [ISO.org](http://iso.org) for more details. A draft version of teh ISO document is available for registered users.

XML Schema definition [XSD](https://github.com/gieschef/EQX/blob/master/Spec/EquipmentExchange.xsd) and some additional informations are available in this repository as well. 


## standard toolsets available
For making usage and implementation as easy as possible we provide libraries for handling EQX in different programming languages. 
Using these libraries makes teh handling transparent and breaks the implementation down to mapping your individual domain model to the EQX objects.  

Those libraries will be available soon for Java , C# and Python.
Check out the repositories here
